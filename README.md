Phishing Websites are a form of fraud that involves an attacker disguising a webpage as a
credible entity to trick a victim into supplying sensitive information. In the technological age, this
attack has become increasingly common, and identifying phishing websites is important for our
cybersecurity.

The “PhishingWebsites” dataset from OpenML is a reliable public training dataset that covers all
the important features that have been proven to be effective in predicting phishing websites as
well as some additional features. The dataset is a large one with 11055 different instances. The
target of this dataset is 2 distinct binary values representing ‘true’ or ‘false’ in regards to whether
the instance is a phishing website or not. There are 31 original features to this dataset, some of
which include: URL length, port, age of the domain, has an IP address, and more.

The goal of identifying phishing websites is a binary classification problem. This report will cover
three main machine learning models of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
and Neural Networks to train models to classify phishing websites accurately. In addition, this
report will also cover various feature transformations, regularization techniques, and
modifications to the dataset in an attempt to improve the accuracy of each of the models.
